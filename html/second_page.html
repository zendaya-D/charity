            <h2>Help Us To Feed Displaced Kids In Gaza</h2>
            <p>Thousands of Palestinian children lack basic needs such as food and clean water. Displaced families have nothing they can do but <em>wait</em> for precious aid that's already being restricted in how much passes through to refugee camps.</p>
            <p>Even $5 can help to feed a hungry child. Please give generously.</p>
